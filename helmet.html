<h1>Minimal Structural Cycling Helmet</h1>

<p class="subtitle">
A lean, structurally expressive cycling helmet designed through anthropometric study,
material reduction, iterative prototyping, and controlled structural refinement.
</p>

</section>


<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The Indian cycling helmet market is divided between bulky entry-level EPS shells
and aggressively styled premium variants. Entry-level products prioritize affordability
but compromise structural clarity, while premium helmets increase segmentation and cost.
</p>

<p>
This project investigates a structurally honest alternative —
a helmet defined by rib continuity, controlled void placement,
and material efficiency rather than decorative surface treatment.
</p>

</section>


<!-- PROBLEM -->
<section>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
How might we reduce material mass, improve airflow efficiency,
maintain IS 4151 compliance, and preserve ergonomic comfort —
while remaining manufacturable within a constrained cost bracket?
</p>

</section>


<!-- MARKET -->
<section>

<h2>Market Research & Positioning</h2>

<p>
A comparative study across Straus, Firefox Youth, Benstar,
Kmart, and Cockatoo revealed pricing between ₹300–₹1500.
Most helmets rely on thick EPS shells and repetitive vent patterns.
</p>

<p>
There is a clear gap for a lean structural helmet positioned between ₹400–₹900,
emphasizing clarity of form rather than aggressive segmentation.

<!-- ANTHROPOMETRIC FOUNDATION -->
<section>

<h2>Anthropometric & BIS Standard Study</h2>

<p>
The foundational geometry of the helmet was derived from IS 4151:1993 headform standards. 
Instead of designing visually first and correcting proportion later, the internal volume 
was constructed around standardized head circumference ranges between 500mm and 620mm.
</p>

<p>
Particular attention was given to crown height, temporal width, and occipital projection. 
These measurements informed structural rib placement and ensured that airflow voids 
did not compromise coverage in critical impact zones.
</p>

<p>
This early integration of anthropometric constraints prevented over-design and 
ensured that the minimal structural system remained compliant and realistic.
</p>

</section>



<!-- DESIGN STRATEGY -->
<section>

<h2>Design Strategy: Structure as Identity</h2>

<p>
Rather than layering decorative surfaces, the design strategy centered around 
structural subtraction. Material was removed wherever load transfer was unnecessary, 
allowing ribs to define the visual language.
</p>

<p>
The central drop-shaped crown void emerged as both ventilation channel and 
load redistribution anchor. Peripheral ribs were thickened selectively 
to maintain impact stability while reducing total mass.
</p>

<p>
The result is a helmet that appears skeletal yet stable — visually lightweight 
but structurally intentional.
</p>

</section>



<!-- CLAY EXPLORATION -->
<section>

<h2>Clay Form Exploration</h2>

<p>
Physical clay modeling allowed real-scale evaluation of curvature transitions 
and rib continuity. Multiple iterations were tested to understand how surface 
tension influences perceived stability.
</p>

<p>
Early clay models failed due to excess thickness at the crown and 
imbalanced lateral distribution. These failures informed material subtraction 
and edge refinement in later stages.
</p>

<p>
Clay exploration validated the structural rhythm before committing 
to digital precision.
</p>

</section>



<!-- CAD DEVELOPMENT -->
<section>

<h2>Digital Modelling & Structural Refinement</h2>

<p>
The refined clay direction was translated into Fusion 360 for parametric control. 
Rib thickness, curvature continuity, and vent proportions were iterated digitally.
</p>

<p>
Wall thickness adjustments were tested to balance rigidity and material efficiency. 
Stress concentration at rib intersections was minimized through controlled fillet transitions.
</p>

<p>
Digital symmetry validation ensured that structural balance remained intact 
while preserving the subtractive design language.
</p>

</section>



<!-- 3D PRINTING -->
<section>

<h2>3D Printing & Iterative Prototyping</h2>

<p>
Prototypes were fabricated through 3D printing to test ergonomic fit and 
structural performance. Print orientation significantly affected rib strength 
and layer adhesion.
</p>

<p>
Early iterations revealed cracking at thin intersections and minor warping 
under load simulation. These insights led to localized reinforcement 
without compromising overall minimalism.
</p>

<p>
Each iteration improved structural clarity while preserving material efficiency.
</p>

</section>



<!-- USER VALIDATION -->
<section>

<h2>User Fit Validation</h2>

<p>
Fit testing evaluated crown clearance, neck mobility, ear alignment, 
and airflow perception. The skeletal structure reduced visual bulk 
while maintaining essential protective coverage.
</p>

<p>
Users reported improved breathability and reduced perceived weight 
compared to conventional EPS-heavy helmets.
</p>

<p>
The final geometry balanced comfort, airflow, and structural integrity 
within the intended cost bracket.
</p>

</section>


<!-- CONCLUSION -->
<section>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The final helmet achieves structural clarity through subtraction.
Its identity emerges from ribs, voids, and load-bearing geometry —
demonstrating how intentional material reduction
can coexist with cost efficiency and ergonomic integrity.
